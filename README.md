Project Euler is a website (named after [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler)) created back in 2001. 
It hosts a collection of around 700 different algorithm problems that get progressively harder, with a new one added once every one or two weeks.
These problems are meant to be solved with the help of a computer, therefore knowing how to code in at least one programming language is a requirement.

Here is [a list of all the problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

## Should I be Posting These?
Quoting from the [Project Euler FAQ](https://projecteuler.net/about):
>### I learned so much solving problem XXX so is it okay to publish my solution elsewhere?

>It appears that you have answered your own question. There is nothing quite like that "Aha!" moment when you finally beat a problem which you have been working on for some time.
It is often through the best of intentions in wishing to share our insights so that others can enjoy that moment too. Sadly, however, that will not be the case for your readers.
Real learning is an active process and seeing how it is done is a long way from experiencing that epiphany of discovery. Please do not deny others what you have so richly valued
yourself.

Project Euler team have invested so much of their time and energy in crafting beautiful problems and they ask for users not to publicly share their solutions. 
But since they themselves understand that the first hundred or so problems have for some time now publicly shared on Github, blogs, videos, and so on, I created this repository
where I upload my solutions for the first 100 problems.

 **WARNING : Peeking the solution of these problems spoils the fun, unless you have already solved the problems. Keep in mind that the reason for publishing the solution
 of a problem is because reading about other approaches can be just as educational as solving the problem.**

However, i created a second **```private```** repository containing my solutions for problems that are greater than 100. If anyone wants to access this repository, feel free
to ask for it with an issue and i will grant you access.

**Note: This is a work in progress. Currently i'm working on **```problem 8```**, so the private repository is not created yet.**
